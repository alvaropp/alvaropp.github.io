    (#) PythonTool Mod: <em>Python inside Minecraft!</em>

    <p>This project consisted in the creation of PythonTool, a Minecraft mod which allows visual and interactive in-game execution of Python scripts which alter the Minecraft world in real time. It makes use of existing software libraries such as mcpi and RaspberryJam-Mod, and tries to improve and ease the programming experience. A non-traditional programming workflow using Jupyter Notebook is also proposed to complement the mod. This project was developed at the University of Southampton under the supervision of Prof Hans Fangohr.</p>

    <p>Skills: Java, Python, Jekyll, continuous integration.</p>

    <p>&lt;br&gt;

The game Minecraft has been extremely successful in the last five years, with over 106 million copies sold, making it the second best-selling video game up to date. Its educational capabilities have been exploited in a variety of ways already across the world. In this project, we try to improve the ways that programming can be taught to young learners, by employing a modification (mod) of the game.

The possibility to employ Python to alter a Minecraft world in real time has been around for a number of years, provided by the game&#39;s creators. However, we believe that the usual text editor &amp; console duo is daunting for young learners or people with limited programming experience. To overcome these difficulties, this mod attempts to *gamify* the programming experience, where players can write Python scripts which get ported inside the game as Python script objects, which can be held, dropped, and used with the click of a mouse. This resembles the way that any other weapon, tool or block is used within the game. Any number of different Python scripts can be put in the player&#39;s inventory, and they can be all used together in an interactive way.

Detailed installation and user guides can be found in the project&#39;s website. We recommend the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Adventures+in+Minecraft-p-9781118946916&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adventures in Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; by David Whale and Martin O&#39;Hanlon to learn more about Python programming and Minecraft.

From a technical perspective, PythonTool is made with Java using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://files.minecraftforge.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; modding framework. It supports several recent versions of Minecraft and the mod&#39;s `.jar` files are built automatically using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.circleci.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt; upon Github commits, and uploaded to the downloads section of the official website.

    ![ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4785303/284628120-4e1128dd-4edd-4951-9cbb-5bb17c2eb8ce.jpg
    width="150px" align=left) I'm a researcher and data scientist at Siemens, working on a variety of topics around
    predictive maintenance, including time series forecasting and anomaly detection, using technologies such as neural
    networks, LLMs and Bayesian models.

    Formerly, I did a PhD in the Agents, Interaction and Complexity group, at the University of Southampton in the UK.
    My research studied the interaction between large fleets of electric vehicles and electricity markets. By using
    techniques from different fields of AI, we were able to coordinate the charging of electric vehicles in order to
    achieve lower prices and reduced congestion. More information about my research can be found in the publications
    section.

    In my free time, I sometimes engage in side projects which usually lie somewhere between computer science,
    electronics and education. These experiments occasionally get featured in cool websites and magazines, or win small
    prizes. Relevant projects I've worked on can be found in the projects section.

    I also enjoy the outdoors and can be often found climbing, running, cycling or hiking.

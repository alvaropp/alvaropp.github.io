title: Bicycle turn indicator
description: be safe! 
brief: A small turn indicator for bicycles. Comes in a compact box that can be easily attached to the saddle stem and a small switch that can be placed in the handlebar. Using the switch the rider can indicate right/left turns, which are displayed by arrow-shaped blinking LEDs. It tries to improve riding safety at night when sticking your hand out to indicate turns is not very visible.

<br>The device can be built very cheap as it employs simple analogue electronics. Specifically, an astable multivibrator with two transistor-capacitor pairs generates the blinking behaviour. Plain red or orange LEDs are quite bright at night if adequately pointed towards cars behind the cyclist.<br>

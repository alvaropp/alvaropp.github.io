description: IoT for long-distance partners
brief: Use the Internet-of-Things in order to make long-distance relationships less distant! The Emotion Box is an Internet-enabled small box which is connected to a mobile app. It has five LEDs which can be switched on and off using the physical buttons on the box, or via the app. Each of the LEDs correspond to a mood, which is engraved in the box. It tries to provide tangible and physical communication to long-distance partners.

title: Keep Exploring
description: Guildford
brief: Inspired by <a href="http://davis.vilums.me/all-the-streets/" target="_blank">Davis Vilums</a> and <a href="https://imjustwalkin.com/" target="_blank">Matt Green</a>, I've started walking and cycling all the streets and paths in Guildford Borough. This is just a way of turning something that I was kind of doing already into a more systematic and data rich project that can make the COVID-19 lockdown more enjoyable.

The idea is to visit every street, road, path and trail in Guildford Borough using my feet and my bikes. I record these activities using <a href="https://www.komoot.com/user/807017409913" target="_blank">Komoot</a> and embed the routes in an interactive map (that should be getting fuller with time) using <a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium" target="_blank">Folium</a>. This map is available <a href="http://alvarop.me/keep-exploring/" target="_blank">here</a> and embedded in the following frame:

<div class="video-container">

</div>

This project should be easy to replicate using your own routes and area. It is a great way to get to know your surroundings better and you would be surprised about what you can find in a 20min ride from your doorstep!

title: Instant Camera
description: with a thermal printer!
brief: An instant camera, Polaroid style. It consists of three separate parts. Namely, a broken action camera which only powers on when connected to power through USB, a Raspberry Pi and a thermal printer like the ones commonly used for purchase receipts. The three things are relatively portable and can be easily powered off a powerbank. Stills are taken with the push of a button which is fixed to the Raspberry Pi's case, and can be instantly printed with a second press when the printer is connected.

The thermal printer itself is a [Pipsta](http://www.pipsta.co.uk/){:target="_ blank"}, which comes with support for the Raspberry Pi, and plenty of [code examples](https://bitbucket.org/ablesystems/pipsta/overview){:target="_ blank"}. Specifically, for this project I adapted the [Image_print](https://bitbucket.org/ablesystems/pipsta/src/d7d323dadf949eaff7296a0e89f182081ed947de/Examples/8_Image_Print/image_print.py?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default){:target="_ blank"}. On the camera side, it is a nearly-bricked [SJ4000](https://sjcam.com/product/sj4000/){:target="_ blank"}, which can be interfaced from Raspbian as any other webcam. I soldered a temporary pushbutton and a status LED to two of the RPi's GPIO pins, and fixed these to the RPi's case. Using `cron` I run a Python script which monitors the button presses and, depending on whether the printer is connected to the RPi, takes a still or prints the most recently stored picture. This way, several stills can be taken without the printer, and then printed all together.
